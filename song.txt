Hank, Beugard, Big Sur
Y'all know how this - go, you know
All eyes on me, OG
Roll up in the club and shit (is that right?)


I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' - tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of - every time we ride
Hittin' - up when we pass by
